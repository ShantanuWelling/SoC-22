# SoC-22
Stock Market Trend Predictor using Deep Learning

Week 1 Assignments were [Assignment for Snippet Completion](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/AssignmentForSnippetCompletion_Shantanu.ipynb) and an [optional assignment](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/Assignment%201%20optional%20Goodstein.ipynb) regarding Goodstein Sequences.
These were basic python programming exercises which involved classes and loops.

Week 2 Assignments were [Momentum](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/Momentum_Shantanu.ipynb) and [Pairs](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/Pairs_Shantanu.ipynb)
These involved data analysis and use of technical financial analysis indicators to engage in stock trading and expanding portfolio.

[Implementation Summary](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/Implementation%20Summary.pdf) was prepared which contained
a brief timeline and steps that would be taken to implement the paper [CNN-LSTM](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/CNN-LSTM.pdf).

Final step was the implementation of the CNN-LSTM model to predict stock prices of the given dataset of Tata Motors stocks. 
Here is the [final implementation](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/SoC%20final%20Shantanu.ipynb).
Here is the [dataset](https://github.com/ShantanuWelling/SoC-22/blob/main/tata.csv) that was used for this implementation.
